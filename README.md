# VR Headset Immersion Level Prediction

## Introduction

In this project, I tackled the fascinating challenge of predicting the Immersion Level of a VR headset user based on a variety of features, including Age, Gender, VRHeadset type, Duration of use, and the presence of Motion Sickness. Immersion Level plays a crucial role in the user experience of virtual reality, and being able to predict it accurately has practical implications for the VR industry.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, I embarked on a multiclass classification task to predict Immersion Levels. My primary goal was to assess and compare the performance of different machine learning models, including both classic machine learning algorithms and a deep neural network model implemented using Keras.

## Key Findings

After an extensive evaluation and comparison of the models, I arrived at several key findings:

- **Keras Deep Learning Model Shines**: The deep neural network model implemented with Keras stood out as the top performer in this project. It achieved the highest accuracy and consistently demonstrated superior performance in predicting Immersion Levels.

- **Power of Deep Learning**: The success of the Keras model highlights the capability of deep learning, especially when dealing with complex multiclass classification tasks. Its ability to extract intricate patterns from the data proved crucial in achieving accurate predictions.

- **Model Selection Matters**: My project reinforces the significance of selecting the right techniques and models tailored to the specific problem and dataset. In this case, the choice of Keras for deep learning played a pivotal role in achieving superior predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my VR Headset Immersion Level Prediction project showcases the effectiveness of Keras, a deep learning framework, in accurately predicting Immersion Levels in VR headset users. The project's findings emphasize the importance of leveraging appropriate techniques and models to tackle complex multiclass classification tasks effectively.

This project not only contributes to my understanding of VR user experience but also serves as a testament to the power of deep learning in enhancing predictive accuracy. I hope that my work will be valuable to the VR industry and inspire further exploration in the field of immersive technology.
